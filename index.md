# Multi-Omics COVID-19 Severity Classification

Welcome to the companion site for my master's thesis project on using machine learning methods—**PCA** and **Variational Autoencoders (VAE)**—for multi-omics classification of COVID-19 severity.

---

## 🔍 Overview

This project explores:
- Dimensionality reduction with PCA and VAE
- Classification of COVID-19 severity using clinical, metabolomics, and proteomics data
- Stacking ensemble models to combine predictions across omics types
- Model interpretation with SHAP and LIME
